## Required Components

| Component | Quantity | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Arduino Uno R4 WiFi | 1 | - |
| LED | 1 | Standard LED |
| Resistor 220Ω | 1 | Current limiting |
| Breadboard | 1 | - |
| Jumper wires | 2 | - |

## Wiring

- LED anode (long leg) → 220Ω resistor → Pin 9
- LED cathode (short leg) → GND
